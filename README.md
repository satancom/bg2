# bg2
Little program that makes a combined graph of CytoExpert output graphs, parsing the position on the grid from names of image files.

Has GUI.
Requires pillow package

Takes file names in format:
ABC_3D6*
Where ABC is the plate name, 3 is the plate number, D and 6 are position on the grid

CD_FACS folder contains example graphs that can be used to check out how the programm works, but .py file is self-sufficient (as long as you have python and packages).
